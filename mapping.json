From Elasticsearch 7.0.0, we are no longer allowed to specify the _doc key, 
so we need to nest the dynamic and properties keys directly under the mappings key.
 The rest of the query remains the same. The query should therefore be the following 
 for Elasticsearch 7.x and onwards.

PUT /product
{
  "mappings": {
    "dynamic": false,
    "properties": {
      "in_stock": {
        "type": "integer"
      },
      "is_active": {
        "type": "boolean"
      },
      "price": {
        "type": "integer"
      },
      "sold": {
        "type": "long"
      }
    }
  }
}
If you are migrating data from version 6.x indices to 7.x, you may specify 
a include_type_name query parameter and set it to true. This allows you to keep 
using the query containing the _doc key until version 8.0.0, at which point the
 parameter will be removed. I recommend that you do not use this parameter unless you 
 have a reason for doing so.

If you want to save a bit of typing, you can copy the above query to have
 it ready for the next lecture if you are following along. You can also find
  it within the GitHub repository.

I am working on a course update to bring all of the queries 100% up
 to date with the latest version of Elasticsearch. I apologize for the 
 inconvenience until the update is ready, and thank you for your patience!
